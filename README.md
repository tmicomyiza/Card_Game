#Description:

This is an iOS game between a player and computer. I developed this app as I was learning Swift and Xcode
for the first time.The perfect score is 26 since a deck of cards has 52 cards, there will be 26 rounds
because everytime the button is clicked two cards show up.

Instuctions of the game: click Deal button, then two cards with show up. Those cards are randomly choosen.
Then, the program will evaluate value of each card, a player with high card gain 1 point.
When two cards of same value are deal, no party gets a score.At the end, the party with bigger number wins the game.
Additionally, high score of the player will be scored. Unlike the first version of this game, a player has a chance to
restart a game anytime by selecting the RESTART BUTTON in the left corner.


#Important files:
ViewController.swift has the backend control of the program. This file is in charge of communicating with UI so that
each part of the screen does the work as intended. Feel free to look at the code.

UI file shows the UI of the actual app.
